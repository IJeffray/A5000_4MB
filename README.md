A 4MB upgrade board for A5000.  Requires flying wire - idea accidentally stolen directly from Ian Stocks; the onboard RAM is set as fully disabled (can be 1M, 2M, 4M, or none at all on the motherboard), but the 'RA9' signal is not provided on the RAM connector, hence the need for the short flying wire.

This has been built and tested successfully.
